# Search GitHub events by username

Basically, I'm trying to replicate a user's activity feed on GitHub, but mostly
this was an exercise to fetch an external API on initial load via React. I've
recently expanded on this by creating a form to fetch different users.

I made this demo as part of my learning process and hope that it will help someone
else along their path in learning React.
